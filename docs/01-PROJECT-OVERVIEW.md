# ComponentCompass - Project Overview

## Elevator Pitch
ComponentCompass is an AI-powered design system navigator that helps developers and designers find, understand, and implement components through natural conversation. Instead of searching through scattered documentation, users ask questions and get intelligent answers with code, visual previews, and accessibility guidance.

## The Problem We're Solving

### Current Pain Points
1. **Fragmented Documentation**: Design system info scattered across Figma, Storybook, GitHub, Confluence, Slack
2. **Context Switching**: Developers waste 2+ hours/week searching for component info
3. **Knowledge Silos**: Design decisions and patterns exist in tribal knowledge
4. **Accessibility Gaps**: Developers don't know which ARIA attributes to use
5. **Implementation Confusion**: "Which button variant for this use case?"
6. **Onboarding Friction**: New team members struggle to learn the design system

### Target Users
- **Primary**: Frontend developers implementing designs
- **Secondary**: Designers checking for existing components
- **Tertiary**: Design system maintainers answering questions

## The Solution

### Core Value Proposition
Ask your design system anything, get intelligent answers with:
- Visual component previews
- Copy-paste ready code
- Accessibility requirements
- Usage examples from production
- Design token references
- Links to Figma components

### Key Differentiators
1. **Multimodal Input**: Text, screenshots, Figma URLs, code snippets
2. **Context-Aware**: Remembers your role, project, and conversation history
3. **Design-Code Bridge**: Shows both Figma components and React implementations
4. **Production Intelligence**: Knows where components are actually used
5. **Accessibility First**: WCAG guidance baked into every response

- ✅ Design-code synchronization
- ✅ Context preservation across tools

## Success Metrics

### Demo KPIs
- Answer accuracy: >90% for common queries
- Response time: <2 seconds end-to-end
- Citation quality: Every claim has source link
- Code quality: Generated code runs without modification

### Real-World Impact Metrics
- Time saved: 2 hours/week per developer
- Onboarding time: Reduced from 2 weeks to 3 days
- Design-code consistency: +40% (fewer implementation variations)
- Accessibility compliance: +60% (more devs use correct ARIA)

## Commercial Viability

### Market Opportunity
- **TAM**: Every company with a design system (10,000+ companies)
- **Competitors**: None (truly novel)
- **Pricing**: $75-150/user/month
- **Initial Target**: Mid-size product companies (50-500 employees)

### Revenue Potential
- 100 companies × 20 users × $100/month = $240K ARR
- Low customer acquisition cost (design system Twitter/LinkedIn)
- High retention (becomes critical infrastructure)

### Product Roadmap
- **V1**: Component Q&A, code generation, accessibility
- **V2**: Design pattern analysis, consistency checking
- **V3**: Automated documentation updates, usage analytics
- **V4**: Multi-design-system support, white-label option

## Tech Stack

### Core Technologies
- **Algolia Agent Studio**: Agent orchestration and retrieval
- **Algolia InstantSearch**: Chat UI components
- **React + TypeScript**: Frontend application
- **Algolia Agentic Components UI Kit**: Ready-made chat widgets
- **OpenAI GPT-4**: LLM (via Agent Studio)

### Data Sources (Algolia Indices)
1. Component metadata (Storybook)
2. Code implementations (GitHub)
3. Design files (Figma API)
4. Accessibility guidelines (WCAG + internal standards)
5. Design tokens (JSON/CSS)
6. Usage analytics (production usage data)
7. Team knowledge (Slack, ADRs, decisions)

## Timeline (3 Weeks)

### Week 1: Foundation (MVP)
- Set up Algolia indices
- Configure Agent Studio
- Build basic chat interface
- Implement simple Q&A

### Week 2: Intelligence
- Add multimodal inputs
- Code generation
- Accessibility integration
- Visual previews

### Week 3: Polish & Demo
- Usage analytics integration
- Video recording
- Submission post
- Testing & refinement

## Demo Data Strategy

### Use Flo Labs Design System
**Advantages**:
- You already know it intimately
- Real production usage data available
- Actual team decisions documented
- 6+ sites to show cross-project intelligence
- Accessibility work you've already done

**Data Collection**:
- Export component metadata from Storybook
- Parse React component files from GitHub
- Pull Figma components via API
- Document accessibility patterns
- Extract design tokens
- Catalog usage across sites

## Next Steps
1. Review technical architecture doc
2. Define data schemas for each index
3. Write Agent Studio prompts
4. Design UI flows
5. Create demo script
6. Start implementation
