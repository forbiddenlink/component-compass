## Remaining TODOs (Before Feb 8 Deadline)

### High Priority - Contest Impact

#### Show Multi-Index Intelligence (Technology - 40%)
- [ ] Add source/index citations to agent responses (show which of the 7 indices were searched)
- [ ] Display index badges after each response (Components, Code Examples, Accessibility, etc.)
- [ ] Make loading indicator index names match actual agent queries

#### Follow-up Suggestions (UX - 25%)
- [ ] Parse suggested follow-up questions from agent responses
- [ ] Render as clickable chips below each response
- [ ] Auto-send on click

#### Usage Analytics Indicators (Innovation - 15%)
- [ ] Show component usage stats in responses (e.g., "Used in 47 places across the codebase")
- [ ] Pull data from `usage_analytics_index`

### Medium Priority - Polish

#### Enhanced Error States
- [ ] Contextual error messages based on error type
- [ ] Suggested alternative queries on failure
- [ ] "View all available components" fallback link

#### Example Queries Carousel
- [ ] Expand example queries beyond the 4 static cards
- [ ] Auto-rotate suggestions to showcase breadth

#### Conversation History Sidebar (Optional)
- [ ] Sidebar listing past conversations
- [ ] Switch between conversations

### Submission Deliverables (Required)

#### Demo Video
- [ ] Write demo script (adapt from docs/07-DEMO-SCRIPT.md)
- [ ] Record 3-5 minute video (1080p, clear audio)
- [ ] Show multi-index intelligence, screenshot detection, source attribution, code examples
- [ ] Edit with captions and annotations
- [ ] Upload to YouTube (unlisted) and get shareable link

#### DEV.to Post (1500+ words)
- [ ] Problem statement and solution overview
- [ ] Technical architecture with screenshots
- [ ] Key features: multi-index search, screenshot detection, accessibility
- [ ] Code snippets showing Algolia integration
- [ ] Embed demo video
- [ ] Tags: #algolia #agentic #designsystem
- [ ] Proofread and publish

#### Deployment
- [ ] Deploy to Vercel with production env vars
- [ ] Test live deployment end-to-end
- [ ] Verify mobile experience on deployed site

#### Final Testing
- [ ] End-to-end testing of all query types
- [ ] Accessibility audit (keyboard nav, screen reader)
- [ ] Performance check (bundle size, response time)
- [ ] Cross-browser testing (Chrome, Safari, Firefox)

#### Pre-Submission (48 hrs before deadline)
- [ ] Verify all links work
- [ ] Check video is accessible
