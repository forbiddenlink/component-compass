**Voiceover**:
"Meet ComponentCompass - an AI agent that knows your design system 
better than anyone on your team.

Built with Algolia Agent Studio, it indexes 7 different data sources:
components, code, Figma designs, accessibility guidelines, design tokens, 
production usage, and team decisions.

Let me show you how it works."

# ComponentCompass: Your Design System, Conversationally

*Finalist entry for the Algolia Agent Studio Challenge - Consumer-Facing Conversational Experiences*

![ComponentCompass Hero Image](url-to-hero-image.png)

## 🎯 The Problem

As a Design Team Lead managing multiple production sites, I've watched developers 
waste hours every week:

- Searching through Figma for the "right" button variant
- Digging through Storybook to find prop names
- Asking in Slack "which spacing token should I use?"
- Copying code from one site to adapt for another

Design systems are supposed to make development faster. But when documentation 
is scattered across Figma, Storybook, GitHub, and tribal knowledge, they become 
a cognitive burden.

**What if you could just *ask* your design system?**

## 💡 The Solution

ComponentCompass is an AI-powered design system navigator built with Algolia Agent Studio. 
Instead of searching through scattered documentation, developers and designers have 
natural conversations to find components, understand patterns, and get production-ready code.

generates the code to recreate it.

![Screenshot: Upload feature](url-to-screenshot-2.png)

**Figma URL Parsing**
Paste a Figma URL, and it automatically fetches component specs, design tokens, 
and implementation code.

![Screenshot: Figma integration](url-to-screenshot-3.png)

### 3. Design-Code Bridge
Every response connects design and implementation:
- Figma components → React code
- Design tokens → CSS variables
- Visual specs → Props

![Screenshot: Design-code bridge](url-to-screenshot-4.png)

### 4. Production Intelligence
Know where and how components are actually used:
- Which sites use this component
- Common prop combinations
- Recent changes and updates

![Screenshot: Usage analytics](url-to-screenshot-5.png)

### 5. Accessibility First
Every code example includes:
- Required ARIA attributes
- Keyboard support
- WCAG compliance notes
- Focus management

## 🏗️ Technical Implementation

### Architecture Overview

ComponentCompass orchestrates 7 Algolia indices using Agent Studio:

```
1. components_index       → Component metadata, props, variants
2. code_implementations   → Real production code examples
3. design_files           → Figma component data
4. accessibility          → WCAG guidelines, ARIA patterns
5. design_tokens          → Colors, spacing, typography
6. usage_analytics        → Production usage data
7. team_knowledge         → ADRs, decisions, patterns
```

### Why Algolia Agent Studio?

**Multi-Index Orchestration**
Agent Studio's ability to query multiple indices in parallel lets me provide 
complete answers that synthesize information from diverse sources.

**Hybrid Search**
Combining keyword and vector search ensures ComponentCompass finds the right 
component whether users ask "delete button" or "destructive action trigger."

**Business Rules**
I enforce team conventions automatically (e.g., always suggest `ButtonPrimary` 
for CTAs, not just "Button").

**Session Memory**
Maintains conversation context so follow-up questions like "make it accessible" 
work naturally.

**Observability**
Built-in tracing helps me understand why the agent responds the way it does 
and continuously improve responses.

### Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS
- **Agent**: Algolia Agent Studio
- **UI Components**: Algolia Agentic Components UI Kit
- **LLM**: OpenAI GPT-4 (via Agent Studio BYO-LLM)
- **Deployment**: Vercel
- **Data Sources**: Flo Labs design system (real production data)

### Key Code Snippets

**Agent Studio Configuration**:
```typescript
// System prompt enforces team conventions and accessibility
const systemPrompt = `
You are ComponentCompass, an expert on the Flo Labs design system.

Team Conventions:
- Primary CTAs → ButtonPrimary variant
- Destructive actions → ButtonDestructive variant
- All interactive elements need keyboard support
- Minimum 3:1 contrast ratio

Always include:
- Production-ready code with TypeScript
- Required accessibility attributes
- Usage examples from real code
- Citations to sources
`;
```

**Multi-Index Query**:
```typescript
// Agent Studio orchestrates queries across all 7 indices
const response = await agentStudio.complete({
  message: userQuery,
  tools: [
    { type: 'algolia_search', index: 'components_index' },
    { type: 'algolia_search', index: 'code_implementations' },
    { type: 'algolia_search', index: 'accessibility_index' },
    // ... all 7 indices available
  ],
  context: {
    userRole: 'developer',
    currentProject: 'robocollective.ai'
  }
});
```

**Hybrid Search Configuration**:
```javascript
{
  searchableAttributes: [
    'name',
    'description',
    'keywords',  // Keyword search
    'useCases'
  ],
  indexSettings: {
    enableVectorSearch: true  // Semantic search
  }
}
```

## 🎨 Design Decisions

### User Experience Principles

1. **Zero Learning Curve**: Natural conversation, no query syntax
2. **Complete Answers**: Code + accessibility + examples in one response
3. **Progressive Disclosure**: Essentials first, details on request
4. **Fast Feedback**: Sub-2-second responses, visual confirmation
5. **Accessible First**: WCAG AA compliant interface

### Visual Design

- Clean, minimal interface focuses attention on content
- Code blocks with syntax highlighting and one-click copy
- Component previews inline for visual confirmation
- Citations prominently linked to build trust
- Dark/light theme support
